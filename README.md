# Byzantine Prototype (Unity)

Prototype repo for a 3D open world, low poly +  texture, third-person adventure.
This repo is expected to evolve; successful systems may be migrated into a polished “production” repo.

## Goals (Prototype)
- Responsive third-person movement
- Basic combat loop
- Low-poly/PS2-era vibe (imagination-first)

## Tech
- Unity (URP)
- Git LFS for binary assets

## Conventions
- All project assets live under `Assets/_Project/`
- Scenes in `Assets/_Project/Scenes/`
